# Specification Quality Checklist: Automatic Meeting Recorder (Memofy v0.1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: February 12, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED (February 12, 2026)

All quality criteria met. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Changes Made During Validation**:
- Removed implementation-specific details (OBS WebSocket versions, file paths, macOS LaunchAgent)
- Abstracted technical terms to business-friendly language ("recording backend" vs "OBS", "monitoring service" vs "daemon")
- Made success criteria technology-agnostic
- Added explicit Dependencies and Assumptions section
